Our gratitude to mr.Bellman 

My personal apologize cause this dont work 

I tried to do it in Java to give myself a break in two years but overestimated my Java capabilities, which are none, and ended up stuck in a hole of my own making.
Hope its enough to get me over the line!


I added a dynamically programmed Fibonacci to boost my chances!
